## Suggested website section layout

1. **By Term** (Term 1 / Term 2 / Term 3 / Additional)
2. **By Strand** (Algebra, Number, Geometry, Statistics, Trig, Graphs, Proof, Vectors)
3. **Topic Pages** (each topic page includes: overview, core methods, common errors, exam-style practice, stretch)
4. **Practice & Assessment Hub** (trials, cumulative reviews, mark-scheme links)
